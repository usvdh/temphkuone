The Opleidingscommissie (OC) is a consultative body composed of students and teachers. Their main task is to advise the school's director on promoting and ensuring the quality of the programs. HKU has a total of ten OCs, which meet for meetings at least seven times per (educational) year. In addition to the meetings, OCs often organize one or more working sessions.
